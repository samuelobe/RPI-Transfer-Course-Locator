# RPI Transfer Course Locator
This script will access Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's SIS Transfer Course Guide and locate every school that offers a specific transferable course.

### Getting Started
The main.py script requires Python 3, Selenium, and a Chrome installation. You can install Selenium by running, `pip install selenium`, in your prefered terminal. Then you must install webdriver-manager by running, `pip install webdriver-manager`, to get the latest webdriver. After that you should be good to go! The script should take about 5-7 mins to look through every school on SIS.
