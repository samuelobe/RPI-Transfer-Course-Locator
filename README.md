# RPI Transfer Course Locator
This script will access Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute's SIS Transfer Course Guide and locate every school that offers a specific transferable course.

### Getting Started
The main.py script requires Python and Selenium. You can install Selenium by running, `pip install selenium`, in your prefered terminal. There is no need to download a driver. This repository comes with one.

Once you have fulfilled the installtion requirements simply change the settings of the config.py file and run the main.py. The script should take about 5-6 mins to look through every school on SIS.
